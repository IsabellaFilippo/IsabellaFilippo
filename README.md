Hi there, I'm Isabella Filippo! 👋
I'm currently a student at the University of Trieste, where I'm pursuing 🌱 a degree in Computer Engineering. My primary interest 👀 lies in the field of cybersecurity, and I'm eager to explore this ever-evolving domain.

⚡ Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm passionate about sailing and practice karate. These activities not only keep me physically active but also help me maintain a balanced and disciplined lifestyle.
